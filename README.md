# Terraform Setup 

Clone this Repository 

Modify terraform backend file with your Terraform cloud details
File name =  `config.remote.tfbackend`

you will find similar code as follows
```
workspaces { name = "xen-terra" }
hostname     = "app.terraform.io"

```


Add below variables to terraform cloud workspace env variables

Terraform cloud

![](diagrams/tf-cloudJPG.JPG)

add your ssh public key to `sshkey.tf` file . Then you can ssh to bastion host and EKS nodes using your key

you will have to change region in variables.tf file ( Here I used us-west-2 ) and ubuntu AMI in bastinhost.tf


**Run below commands to env setup**
```
terraform login # use terraform cloud API token to authenticate

terraform init -backend-config=config.remote.tfbackend

terraform validate

terraform plan

terraform apply -auto-approve
```

you will get outputs of ECR,EKS,RDS etc.


**Destroy Environemnt**
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve 
```
- In AWS console check RDS snapshots and delete it
